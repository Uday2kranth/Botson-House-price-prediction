# ðŸš€ Hands-on Learning and Deployment of My Own ML Model

This repository contains all the materials, code, and learnings from the *5-day DEVTOWN Bootcamp*, where I followed along with hands-on sessions to build and deploy my first Machine Learning model.  

I learned the fundamentals of Python, Machine Learning models, and web deployment using tools like *Flask, **Pickle, and **Render.com*.  
The final deployed model uses *XGBoost*, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.
